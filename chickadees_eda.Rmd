#GROUP PROJECT 2: CHICKADEES 

##Looking at Persistence and Reliability dataset: 

###Variables
capturedate: date (yyyymmdd) that each bird was captured
site: code of each field site.
indiv: individual band number identification
age: age class – adult or juvenile.
sex: female or male.
habitat: rural (urban score < 0) or urban (urban score > 0) habitat type.
urbanscore: urbanization score generated by PCA analysis used to infer degree of urbanization at each site.
explscore: exploration score generated by PCA analysis.
domscore: dominance score based on interactions between birds at RFID feeders.
lpsolve: whether the lever-pulling task was solved (Y) or not (N).
lplatency: latency to solve or become censored in the lever-pulling trials.
lpstatus: censoring status of latency to solve the lever-pulling task used for cox regression (0 = censored, 1 = uncensored).
lpcontacts: total number of contacts made with the lever-pulling task until the bird solved the task or the observation became censored.
prsolve: whether the paper-ripping task was solved (Y) or not (N).
prlatency: latency to solve or become censored in the paper-ripping trials.
prstatus: censoring status of latency to solve the paper-ripping task used for cox regression (0 = censored, 1 = uncensored).
prcontacts: total number of contacts made with the paper-ripping task until the bird solved the task or the observation became censored




TRIAL 1: Lever 

Variables: 

indiv: individual band number identification
latency: latency to solve or become censored in the lever-pulling trials
status: censoring status of latency to solve the lever-pulling task used for cox regression (0 = censored, 1 = uncensored)
tstart: start time (in seconds) of each time interval used for the extended cox regression
tstop: stop time (in seconds) of each time interval used for the extended cox regression
contacts: number of contacts made with the task in each time interval
domscore: dominance score based on interactions between birds at RFID feeders.
urbanscore: urbanization score generated by PCA analysis used to infer degree of urbanization at each site.
explscore: exploration score generated by PCA analysis.
solve: indicator of whether the task was solved in each time interval (0 = unsolved, 1 = solved)
site: code of each field site.
habitat: rural (urban score < 0) or urban (urban score > 0) habitat type.
age: age class – adult or juvenile.
sex: female or male.


```{r}
skim(lever)

lever %>% group_by(indiv) %>% count()

birds_solve = lever %>% filter(solve == 1) %>%  group_by(indiv) %>% summarize(time = max(tstop), status, status)
#38 of the 65 birds in dataset solved teh problem 


lever %>% group_by(indiv) %>% summarize(time = max(tstop), status, solve)


lever %>% group_by(status, indiv) %>% summarize (time = max(tstop))
```

EDA FINDINGS: 

- There are only 65 birds in this trial 
- The covariates/characteristics here are domscore, urbanscore, explscore
- contacts.
