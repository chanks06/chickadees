File descriptions

LeverPullingPerformance.csv: Contains data on characteristics of individuals and measures from lever-pulling trials sorted to recreate the reported extended cox regression analysis.

Column: Description

LeverPullingPerformance$indiv: individual band number identification
LeverPullingPerformance$latency: latency to solve or become censored in the lever-pulling trials
LeverPullingPerformance$status: censoring status of latency to solve the lever-pulling task used for cox regression (0 = censored, 1 = uncensored)
LeverPullingPerformance$tstart: start time (in seconds) of each time interval used for the extended cox regression
LeverPullingPerformance$tstop: stop time (in seconds) of each time interval used for the extended cox regression
LeverPullingPerformance$contacts: number of contacts made with the task in each time interval
LeverPullingPerformance$domscore: dominance score based on interactions between birds at RFID feeders.
LeverPullingPerformance$urbanscore: urbanization score generated by PCA analysis used to infer degree of urbanization at each site.
LeverPullingPerformance$explscore: exploration score generated by PCA analysis.
LeverPullingPerformance$solve: indicator of whether the task was solved in each time interval (0 = unsolved, 1 = solved)
LeverPullingPerformance$site: code of each field site.
LeverPullingPerformance$habitat: rural (urban score < 0) or urban (urban score > 0) habitat type.
LeverPullingPerformance$age: age class Ð adult or juvenile.
LeverPullingPerformance$sex: female or male.
